          Hello traveler! This image was generated using the "_oblivion_dialogue" template.
          That template takes 4 arguments: backdrop, character_reference, character_name, and dialogue.
          Notice how each is lead with a dollar sign. That indicates it is a variable.
          Also notice the at sign. That indicates that we are referencing an object, like a character.
          This let's us create reusable characters.
    _inventory:
      image:
        template: _oblivion_inventory
        $character_reference: "@characters._nick.reference_photo"
        $inventory_items: empty skooma bottle
        $background: Inside a medieval tavern
        $extra_instructions: The character is in a bed, with Skooma bottles on his bedside table.

  name: Abandoned Campsite

    _inventory:
      image:
        template: _oblivion_inventory
        $character_reference: "@characters._nick.reference_photo"
        $inventory_items: empty skooma bottle, diary entry, heavy armor
        $background: At an abandoned campsite in the forest
        $extra_instructions: The character is wearing heavy weight chest armor that has been dented from battle
